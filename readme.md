# Newsletter Signup

By following the course from @angelabauer, I was able to build this simple signup page, wich can get hold of the user informations and save them on Mailchimp.

It was a initial project, made with Node, simple frontend solutions and integration with Mailchimp API

It was deployed on Heroku for checking results of the developing study.

It is possible to check it out on the link: https://pure-shelf-52323.herokuapp.com/
